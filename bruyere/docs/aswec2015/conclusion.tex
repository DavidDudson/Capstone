\section{Conclusion}

We have presented SoGaCo, a browser-based educational environment for teaching programming and algorithms and data structures. While we have not yet systematically evaluated SoGaCo, evidence from end user testing with a group of 25 students suggests that this environment can promote engagement and participation. More work on validation is planned with several universities and highschools in the near future. 

There are several technical features we plan to integrate, such as traceability and visualisation of code execution, similar to the respective feature of the Python tutor \cite{GuoSIGCSE2013}, the provision of a console for bots, support for code autocompletion, and support to organise tournaments.
